##   
     
*In my opinion - Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is outpacing other cloud IAAS/PAAS services in the race to be the premier provider.*
### Background  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've used cloud PAAS providers both personally/professionally for the last 4 years in small scale consulting and personal projects and can attest that they live up to the hype.  Easy to develop, deploy, and administer applications along with services.  The offerings to be had continue to increase and diversify - all with an inversely correlated drop in price.  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now by no means have I taken advantage of the scale with which these some of these platforms are available - but the ability to do so (especially from the comfort of my couch) - can provide the means with which almost anyone with an idea can produce something on a scale previously obtainable only with a large budget to buy equipment and hire people.
