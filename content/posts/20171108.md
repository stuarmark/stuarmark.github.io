##   
tldr;*In my opinion - Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is outpacing other cloud IAAS/PAAS services in the race to be the premier provider.*
### Background  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've used cloud PAAS providers both personally/professionally for the last 4 years in small scale consulting and personal projects and can attest that they live up to the hype.  Easy to develop, deploy, and administer applications along with services.  The offerings to be had continue to increase and diversify - all with an inversely correlated drop in price.  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now by no means have I taken advantage of the scale with which these some of these platforms are available - but the ability to do so (especially from the comfort of my couch) - can provide the means with which almost anyone with an idea can produce something on a scale previously obtainable only with a large budget to buy equipment and hire people.
### Documentation  
https://cloud.google.com/docs/

The documentation is clearly laid out and you can find what you want either by looking through the products and services heirachy (Compute, Containers, Storage, etc) or you can look at specific programming languages and how to use them on the GCP (GO, Node.js, Java, etc)
### Product And Service Highlights
Some of the standout features of the GCP include:

Security - https://cloud.google.com/security/

Billing - https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/

Databases/Big Data - https://cloud.google.com/products/storage/ & https://cloud.google.com/products/big-data/

Network - https://cloud.google.com/products/networking/
### Partnerships
There is an extensive list of companies who partner with GCP and can be found here:  https://cloud.google.com/partners/.  One partnership that has been in the news recently was between Google and Salesforce.  Salesforce will not only build out it's global infrastructure on the GCP but they will also integrate Salesforce CRM with G-Suite to include real time collaboration for Google Docs, allow customers to use Hangouts Meet for collaboration/communication, and use Gmail directly in the Salesforce platform.
###Wrapping It Up
The GCP offers alot to businesses and users - with Google's experience in building and managing some of the largest systems in the world - you can reap the benefits of all that the GCP has to offer in all aspects of developing, deploying, and administering applications and services in the cloud.
